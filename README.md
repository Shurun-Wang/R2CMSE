# R2CMSE
This is the Official source code repository of the R2CMSE algorithm.

R2CMSE is used to calculate the entropy of 1-channel signal.

You can directly run the "r2cmse_main.m" file in MATLAB.

We use multiple pink noises with the length of 500 as the example, you can change it to your own 1-channel data series.
