# R2CMSE
![Visitors](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path=https://github.com/Shurun-Wang/R2CMSE&label=visitors&countColor=%232ccce4&style=plastic) This is the official source code repository of the R2CMSE algorithm.

R2CMSE is used to calculate the entropy of 1-channel signal. You can directly run the "r2cmse_main.m" file in MATLAB. We use multiple pink noises with the length of 500 as the example, you can change it to your own 1-channel data series.
